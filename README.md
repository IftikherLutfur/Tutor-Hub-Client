## Tutor Hub Overview
Tutor Hub is a platform designed to connect students and tutors. It allows for the registration of two types of users: Tutors and Students. Tutors can register and provide their services in various subjects, while students can search for tutors based on the subjects they want to learn.

## Key Features of Tutor Hub

Tutor Registration: Tutors can sign up to create their accounts, where they will provide information such as the subjects they teach, experience, and availability. Once registered, their data will be displayed on the Find Tutor route. Students can filter the available tutors based on the subject they wish to learn and then contact tutors through their phone numbers or email.
Student Registration: Students can also register and create an account. They will have the ability to search for tutors, view profiles, and communicate with them to arrange lessons.
