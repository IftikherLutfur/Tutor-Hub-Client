# Tutor Hub Overview
Tutor Hub is a platform designed to connect students and tutors. It allows for the registration of two types of users: Tutors and Students. Tutors can register and provide their services in various subjects, while students can search for tutors based on the subjects they want to learn.

# Key Features of Tutor Hub

Tutor Registration: Tutors can sign up to create their accounts, where they will provide information such as the subjects they teach, experience, and availability.
